                <h3>Ryan's Rescue Squad</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Yes.. another Ryan game...</p>
                <br>
                <p>Me and a Race with Ryan mod decided to run this game for the fun of it. Turns out, it's a really nice, relaxing platformer. Of course, it is a baby platformer, but still I was quite surprised that the developers actually put SOME effort into it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But of course, with every Outright Games video game, there are countless glitches. You can clip through the floor, the enemy hit detection is shit, if you hit a ledge after jumping out of the water it sends you flying, and oh yeah! The bosses are recycled! Same way they attack, same way you attack them. Wow.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And as a speedgame? Not bad! It's really fun, and there is some "movement tech". Like using the clips to your advantage, and if you attack near a ledge it creates a boost.</p>
                <br>
                <p>An unfortunate thing tho, is that a different person is a mod for the game. What's sad is that mod is barely active, and even after reaeching out to them they still haven't responded. We really hope something will happen.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyways, the game is split into 4 worlds, each world having 5 levels, one minigame, and one boss. In every stage (except the minigames and the boss), there are collectibles, 3 R coins (probably Ryan coins), and 3-6 eggs. Chocolate Eggs? I have no clue. These collectibles serve no purpose than to unlock all costumes in the game.</p>
                <p>Oh yeah! Even tho there are 4 characters, all of them are the same! Wow.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On Speedrun.com there are full game and individual level categories, both having any% and 100% categories.</p>
