                <h3>My adventure into speedrunning</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Honestly I don't have a lot of hobbies. I guess you can call gaming a hobby, but I would call it a fun time waster. I mean I guess hobbies are that, just fun time wasters?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Like everyone else, I love gaming. It's one of the reasons I made Boofny Tech. But honestly as I get older, the more I game less. I don't know why, I guess because they've lost their charm? I guess you could say that I only play a few games, but I try to play as more games as I can, the thing is, after playing any game I get bored after like what, 30 minutes of playing?</p>
                <br>
                <p>With that aside, after gaming for almost all my life, I've been always interested in speedrunning. I just could never find a game that I could commit so much time into.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I was known as Boofny, I actually speedran some games. I started with the Henry Stickmin Collection, and continued with Flash games. I liked speedrunning them, but after like a year or so, I lost interest. It was kind of boring. As I speedran mostly Henry Stickmin, the speedrun consisted of you clicking as fast as you can for the entire run, and that resulted into a lot of broken mice (I actually broke two!), and a lot of pain in my index finger (I clicked with it, yeah).</p>
                <br>
                <p>And after that, I couldn't really decide what to run. I deleted my old speedrun.com account and couldn't find a game to run since.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So, in 2023, and specifically after changing my identity, I actually decided to take speedrunning more seriously. Well, not really seriously, more like, commiting more time into it, rather than speedrunning a game for a year then giving up entirely. And so, I decided to blog about all of my games I'll be running, talking about all of the categories and my progression.</p>
