                <h3>Redesigning my speedrun blog</h3>
                <br>
                <p>So, my previous attempt at this was awful. Really, really awful.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm a speedrunner, I've been following the speedrunning scene ever since I was 6-8 years old, but I haven't actually started until recently. It's very fun.</p>
                <p>And so, the way I decided to show off my times on my site was by manually adding times and talking about the runs. Yeah, even for my obsolete PBs. It was very bad.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The reason for redesigning my site was super random, actually. I was searching the game All-Star Fruit Racing on Speedrun.com and came across a runner called "Jordanlol". They have a site dedicated to their runs. And the way they did it was 10x better than mine. Basically having a horizontal sidebar with their times displayed on them.</p>
                <p><a href="https://jordanlol.com/" target="_blank">Check out the site!</a> It's pretty neat. I decided to base my speedrun times like Jordan's, while not directly copying it, I will use a vertical sidebar, fixed to the left.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As this is a Boofny Tech project, of course, it has to have a name. I am really out of ideas, but I think that "Danin's Dashboard" would be cool.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>When the site is up, <a href=".../danin_index.html" target="_blank"></a>this text will be a hyperlink to the site.</p>
