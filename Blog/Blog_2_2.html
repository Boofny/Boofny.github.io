                <h3>Garfield Kart</h3>
                <br>
                <p>In 2013, a French (ew) game studio made Garfield Kart. Of course, with everything Garfield related, it became a giant meme. Every Steam review is a meme, and I actually don't know if there are any legit ones. Of course it's not a bad thing, I even left 2 meme reviews on the game and it's sequel/remake? The thing is, most of them are unfunny as fuck.</p>
                <p>No seriously, read some of them, you'll be disappointed on how cringy they are.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyways, the first game (Garfield Kart) is so, so, so bad. It controls like ass, the AI is ass, and it's really frustrating. in higher difficulties (150cc specifically), you and the other racers will be so close to each other that, when someone hits you (which they will, VERY frequently), you'll go from first place to all the way to 7th to last place.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Then, they made a remake/sequel in like 2018 called Garfield Kart: Furious Racing. It's just an upgrade from the original game. And if you plan on getting it, get Furious Racing.</p>
                <p>The thing is, the game still has some things that annoy me. Mainly, the <strong>AI</strong>. They were shit in Garfield Kart, and they are shit in Furious Racing. It feels like whoever worked on it, really hated their playerbase, since your fun depends HEAVILY on AI RNG. You can have the best match ever where the AI can provide a hard, but fun challenge, or they can be the worst thing on Earth.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You know how in Mario Kart you'll have some matches where you get hit by 2 blue shells, 3 red shells and one green shell, then fall off the map, all in 10 seconds? Well imagine that in Garfield Kart, but multiply it by 10. The RNG is too insane. There is an item called a "Pie" which functions like a green shell, without the bouncing when it hits the wall. There's a red shell variant called a "Homing Pie". The Homing Pie WILL be your worst enemy. The AI will sometimes be too lucky and always get those when you're first place. I'm talking about Pie, after Pie, after Pie, after Pie... There isn't a blue shell variant in the game, but I  guess there's something similar called the "UFO". Basically, it goes ahead of the person in first place, and you have a 1 in 3 chance on going through the right one. It is heavily improved from the first game, where it doesn't even tell you what the correct one is, but in Furious Racing improves it by scrolling the correct UFO from left to right. The thing is, it's somehow always in a place you don't have enough time to reach, nor react. And another last annoyance, there's a special items what I like to call just a "Pillow". Basically if you use it, it puts asleep every racer on the track for a few seconds. And again, the AI is too lucky and gets it every single time. I had a match where the Pillow was used over <strong>TEN</strong> fucking times. And it is even worse than the original game. In Garfield Kart, what it does is it puts you to sleep, but it your kart accelarates forward slowly. I have no issue with that, but they somehow fucked it up in Furious Racing. When it puts you to sleep, it completely stops the kart, and all of the momentum you had STILL continues. If you were drifting right, the kart will keep going sharply right, resulting in you hittin a wall. It can get insanely frustrating.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Excuse me, I just had to complain since I hate heavy RNG in any game I play. I love Furious Racing, I think it's a really good kart racer. That's why I decided to speedrun it. The controls are soo good compared to Garfield Kart, and it is just a fun game.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The difference between other kart racers and Garfield Kart is that the game has "items" that every character has. Each character has their own car, spoiler, and hat. Each character has different attributes, too. One's faster but handles like ass, one is slow but good handling, etc. The fastest one is Odie. And he is the meta in speedruns.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was thinking to speedrun both Garfield Kart games, but honestly I am not sure. I will see, honestly. I hate the original game to pieces. I can probably make an hour long video hating on it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyways, I learnt from my mistakes from the Race with Ryan entry and made each category into separate pages. So it'll be clean (I should probably do that with Race with Ryan, too huh...)</p>
                <p>Below is every category in Furious Racing (and possibly the original Garfield Kart):</p>
