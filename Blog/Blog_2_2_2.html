                <h3>Crazy Dunes</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Crazy Dunes is the second stage in the game. Like the name says, it's a sand level. It's pretty basic, like all tracks on the first cup. There's a part where you have to drop off, and it can be a little bit tricky to not land on the sand.</p>

                <p>My first run of the stage, and currently my personal best. It's a bad run that I ran just for the fun of it.</p>
