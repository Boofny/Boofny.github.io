                <h3>Finally setting up Boofny Tech</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I had in mind for creating a so called "company" for a while now. Not really a company, just something I could put all of my projects in. That's why I created Boofny Tech.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Boofny Tech doesn't mean anything. It's my old username that I barely use anymore (actually, not at all, I have nicknames in like 2 Discord servers because people know me as 'Boofny'). And I thought why not waste that great of a sounding username, why not use it somewhere, you know?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Honestly I had many ideas to what projects can I do with Boofny Tech. It ranged from creating header libraries for graphics, machine learning, etc. (I watched too much Tsoding lmao), then I wanted it to be a video game company, then this. Let's call it a "old video game preservation" thingy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I love old software and games. I am fascinated by them, and I read about how they work almost every day. My favourite console is the PS1, but I also enjoy older consoles (NES, SNES, SEGA Genesis, etc.), and even old computer machines! I was thinking to blog about how they work, and I think it's somewhat of a good idea. And so I can actually have something to blog about.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Anyways, yeah my love for old software, emulation (eek!) and abandonware lead me to focus Boofny Tech on that. I had in mind to make emulators (I want to create an emulator for every* old PC machine, and for every mainline Nintendo Handheld, and eventually a PlayStation emulator), maybe ROM hacks for them? I don't know really about that, as it seems too time consuming (and I do not have that much time to learn Assembly).</p>
                <br>
                <p>As my favourite console is the PS1, I thought of creating several pieces of software for it. For now, I have in mind to create an .xa and .str file converted and player (Kind of similar to PSMPlay, I believe it was called that?) with a modern GUI. And an application for ripping the game's textures, and the ability to change them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As for abandonware, I am not really sure. I have an archival project of my favourite game in mind, called 'Project LiT', which will be a Boofny Tech web project by the way, but besides that, I am completely out of ideas. Maybe game decompilation? Again, I am not really sure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And that's basically it for now. Well, that's basically all of the "old software" projects. As time moves on, and as I get better at programming, more projects will surely come. Of course, I cannot stick to only this "gimmick", when I get into new hobbies (speedrunning, for example!), I have severeal project ideas for it. For example, game development. Not necesarrily a 'hobby', but it was something I wanted to get into for a long time. As I am currenly learning web development, I'll probably start with web games, then move onto using engines, or a game development library like SDL or Raylib. I even had ideas to create my own engine.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Well that's it for now, I'm happy I actually started working on Boofny Tech. As I actually work on the projects, and as I have more ideas, I will blog about it here.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I don't really know what else to say, thank you for reading this, and I hope you'll find this as interesting as I do.</p>
