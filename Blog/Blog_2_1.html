                <h3>Race with Ryan</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Yes.. Race with Ryan...</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you're unsure what that is, do you know the Youtube channel Ryan's Toy Review? If not, it's a kids' channel focused on toys. I watched it a little bit, back when the channel just started. The channel is still going, with Ryan being 8 year old.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Of course I find that absurd, but we are not here to critisize the channel. You see, Ryan has 2 video games. The one I'll be talking about, Race with Ryan, and a newer one, Ryan's Rescue Squad.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Race with Ryan is a generic kart racer. The track layout is bland and boring, with a shit ton of RNG. The game has like, 5 tracks, I guess you can say it has 10 because they have mirrored versions? Still, the fact that they couldn't come up with more tracks is insane. The game has 6 cups, and yes, all of the tracks are reused.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And the characters are bland, too. They use more characters than Ryan, but honestly I do not know if they're from Ryan's show or some shit, or if they're made up. But yeah there's for example "Pirate Ryan", "Pizza Delivery Ryan", etc. Same with the other characters, they have a crap ton of reskins.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ok, so I critisized the game, but why do I speedrun it then?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Well, first of all I want to say I didn't even buy a game. I got it as a gift from a friend. They got it on a key site for under a dollar! And for the value it's not a bad game, really. The track design is quite interesting, you can see that the creators tried to make the tracks look good. And the driving is actually not that bad! It's quite fun to race around, it doesn't have shit handling! That's the only reason I decided to speedrun it. Besides for the memes, of course.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The speedrun page has 2 full game categories, with, of course, individual level categories for the tracks, with the forward and mirrored versions available. The categories for the full game run is All cups, restricted or unrestricted. The goal is to finish all 6 cups as fast as possible. Restricted means you have to beat the game without using any glitches, while unrestricted, of course, allows the use of glitches. And one thing I should mention is that in individual level runs, the use of items is not allowed. Mostly because the tracks are already filled with RNG, and one player can get lucky and get a lot of boost items and get an unbeatable run. Honestly, I am not sure why don't they ban items in full game runs as well, but whatever.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Ryan's Playroom (IL)</h3>
                <p>I actually decided to run ILs first. Mostly so I can get used to the game, and then do full level runs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My first run of the track:</p>
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NhG0qJd2zTc"></iframe>
                <p>it honestly wasn't that bad for a first run. It was very sloppy, yes, but I wasn't last place! That says something lol. I got hit 2 times by track obstacles, and I didn't use full drifts. Overall, not a bad time for a first run.</p>
                <br>
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tP8jxDgVmzo"></iframe>
                <p>A 10 second improvement! The driving was smooth, and I didn't get hit. Although this was before watching the guide, so I didn't use full drifts (longer drifts). Again, very happy with the run. My current goal is to get a sub 2:40 run, and of course, beat the world record.</p>
                <br>

                <p>My current personal best. Don't have anything to say honestly, I grinded the shit out of it just to get a 1 second improvement.</p>
                <br>

                <p>My first reverse run of the track. This was after I watched the speedrun tutorial made by <a href="https://youtu.be/phsK2HCkH7Y">slnxc</a>, so I tried using many of the tips they mentioned. What's funny is this run was faster than my (then) pb, by 200ms lol.</p>

                <p>My current PB on the reverse track. It was insanely good, and well executed. This is when I started using the "meta" character (which I still have no clue if he's faster, but eh whatever lol)</p>
