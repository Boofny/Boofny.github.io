                <h3>Toys World</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Toys World is the first world in the game. The worlds are pretty basic, mainly for showing you how the game worlds. Also because it's a baby game.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Level 1</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The most basic level in the entire game. And also the shortest. The level focuses on teaching you how to play the game, telling you how to jump, ground pound, attack, that you have to jump on enemies, etc.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I should clarify that there are barely any runs for this game, only one any% run, and 4 IL runs, and that's from the first world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This run was my first run, also the world record. 1 second ahead of it, lol. This was before the movement tech was dicovered, so this is a very basic run.</p>

                <p>Also the first 100% run of the level! Very basic, just collected all collectibles with no minor mistakes, could be improved by using the movement tech (Didn't use them at all during world 1, because it was still a taboo topic lol)</p>
