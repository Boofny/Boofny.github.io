                <h3>Toys World</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Toys World is the first world in the game. The worlds are pretty basic, mainly for showing you how the game worlds. Also because it's a baby game.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Level 1</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The most basic level in the entire game. And also the shortest. The level focuses on teaching you how to play the game, telling you how to jump, ground pound, attack, that you have to jump on enemies, etc.</p>
                <br>

                <p>I should clarify that there are barely any runs for this game, only one any% run, and 4 IL runs, and that's from the first world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This run was my first run, also the world record. 1 second ahead of it, lol. This was before the movement tech was dicovered, so this is a very basic run.</p>

                <p>Also the first 100% run of the level! Very basic, just collected all collectibles with no minor mistakes, could be improved by using the movement tech (Didn't use them at all during world 1, because it was still a taboo topic lol)</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Level 2</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Level 2 features more so the same stuff as level 1. Basic platforming (like the entire game lmfao), but it introduces throwable balls! There are 2 balls in the game, green and purple. Purple balls bounce, while green don't. That's the difference, they both stun stun enemies, and can break blocks.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also springs are introduced. And they're entirely RNG. What I mean by that is sometimes they'll bounce you low, and sometimes high.</p>

                <h3>Level 3</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The only new thing here are the purple throwable balls.</p>
