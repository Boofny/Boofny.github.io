                <h3>Catz in the Hood</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Catz in the Hood is the first stage in the game. It's a really simple simple stage, and probably the most well known.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The individual level categories are divided by 3 laps, and fastest lap. If there's a death abuse, there's a specific category for it, too, and of course, the death abuse cateogry is divided by 3 laps and fastest lap</p>
                <br>
                <p>My plan for the individual levels was to get all platinum times, then move onto individual cups, then the full game</p>
                <br>

                <p>My first ever run of the game, and the stage. It was ok, not a bad run, not a good run, but proud of it nontheless. The intended skip was done way too slowly, I could have saved more time.</p>

                <p>Not that great of an improvement, but still happy with it. The movement was cleaner, and the skip was done better.</p>

                <p>A cleaner run. The skips were done better, although there was a huge room for improvement. Not to mention this time was like 5 seconds ahead compared to my previous run.</p>

                <p>My current personal best. And a sub 1:10, too! Again, cleaner than the previous one. This run landed me in the top 100. Very proud of it, going to get that platinum medal.</p>
